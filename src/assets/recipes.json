    "details": "To make spaghetti alla carbonara, cook 200g spaghetti in salted water until al dente. Meanwhile, chop 100g guanciale (or pancetta) and fry until crispy. In a bowl, beat 2 eggs with 50g grated parmesan and freshly ground pepper. Once the pasta is drained, combine it with the guanciale, then quickly add the egg mixture, stirring until the sauce is creamy. If it is too thick, add a little of the pasta cooking water. Serve with extra cheese and pepper. Enjoy!"

    "details": "First, rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear, then cook it in 300ml of water according to the instructions on the package. Once the rice is cooked, in a separate bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar and salt until dissolved, then gently stir into the warm rice. Place a sheet of nori on a sushi mat (or clean tea towel), spread the rice evenly on it, leaving the edge free. Place your chosen ingredients (vegetables or fish) on the rice, then roll the sushi, starting from the edge with the filling. Apply light pressure to secure the roll. Cut into pieces and serve with wasabi and soy sauce. Enjoy!"
